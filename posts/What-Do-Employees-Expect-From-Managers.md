There are many way to become bad manager. Most of them are related with how you interact with employees. Only the few of them is about how you manage other than employees. If the bigger part of the magement related with managing employees, it is very important to do it in the right way. Also, it will be much benefficient to more focus on those area. Spent less energy, gain more value.
Sounds easy, right? Maybe not.
There are many different kind of management approaches and many different people all around us. It is hard to find your own way and expecting that everybody will happy about it. Maybe we should not focus on approaches and look at the **What really employees are expecting from us?**. It is not that easy to achieve this. But, we can just start looking what we are expecting from our managers. That can be guide us to right directions. I can not speak about everybody's behalf but I can tell you what actually I am expecting from my manager.

## 1. Clear goal
If someone or a company hires me, it means there is something that needs to be accomplished and I need to do it. Often the expected successes at the beginning are clearer than at later times. Time to time expectations are changing or evolving to something else or maybe the goal has been achieved. All those situations there must be a clear communication needs to be established and revisit or renew those goals. If there are some grey areas still available and/or communication had a problem to transmit goals, it become very easy to struggle and change navigation to wrong direction. The first rule is always be clear about what you are expecting. Do not let the people start guessing about expectation. Because that will trigger unexpected problems, or event quit from positions.

## 2. Listen to me
We are social animals. We have our ups and downs. We expect to be understood. But most importantly, we expect other people to listen to us. I am expecting my manager really care about me and listening me when I am speaking. I would like to ask for help, tell about my familly, or even maybe I would like to tell about my new shose. That is the reason we have one-on-one meeting, right? That feel me important. That is important because everybody needs to bee fell imporant. We need it, we have ego and that ego need it. Also, maybe I want to give some sign about my problems and my manager can got those messages and take some actions. Or maybe I want more from him/her. It is important to listen. My manager always takes a notes when we are speaking and I asked why. He told me that taking notes keep him focus on what I am speaking about.  That is a very good trick and it can work in many cases.

## 3. Let me try and fail
Every day, we are learning new things. They can be small things or big things, but we are continuously learning and want to use those new pieces of information and ideas. However, we usually hesitate to test new things because no one wants to fail, especially if you get paid to do something. If you fail, you get all the blame and even worse consequences. It is important to have a secure space to try new things, and if you fail, the manager should understand that you are learning from your mistakes and trying your best.

## 4. Keep away from nonsense
Let me do what I need to do. There are many politics, many decitions, many problem on going outher of my office and all those needs to be handled my managers. If there are budget problem, please manager fix it.

## 5. Career growth
## 6. Do what you say
When someone hires me, I get a lot of promises and I expect those promises to be fulfilled. At least some of them. 

## 7. Competitive salary and benefits
The last rule is salary and benefits. I’ve placed this point last because I don’t believe high salaries and benefits alone guarantee happiness at work. It helps in the short term and doesn't work in the long run. However, putting all of these considerations aside, I expect competitive salary and benefits to be applied fairly. The important point is that the same privileges that apply to everyone else apply to me. No one really can be happy if figure out that there is an unfair salary and privilege policy. Be fair on salary raise and on privileges.
